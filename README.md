# 🌟 Shine On, Idol! - A Gacha Game

## About The Game

**Shine On, Idol!** is a virtual idol card-drawing simulator where players act as producers, building their dream team through draws, upgrades, and collection. Each draw consumes coins, and players can choose between single draws or ten-pull sessions.

The game recreates the joy of gacha games through code—the thrill of drawing your favorites, watching them grow, and gradually completing your collection. It's a relaxed but engaging experience that blends collecting, progression, and light strategy.

## 🎨 Design Inspiration

The idea came from my love of idol-themed character cards—especially the satisfaction of collecting full sets. I've always enjoyed the fantasy of being an idol producer: choosing who to promote and building an attractive team. This project brings that experience to life with 26 unique idols across 4 rarity tiers, each with their own portrait and personality.
